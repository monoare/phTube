          In JavaScript, var, let, and const are generally used to declare
          variables, but they differ in terms of their scope, hoisting behavior,
          and mutability. In this article, i will discuss var, let and const
          with respect to their scope, use, and hoisting.
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal font-semibold ml-4">
          <!-- var -->
          <li>
            <strong>Var:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Function scoped:</strong> var is function scoped when it
              is declared within a function. This means that it is available and
              can be accessed only within that function.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Hoisting:</strong> Variables declared with the var keyword
              are subject to hoisting. If we declare a variable (but do not
              initialize it) at the end of the function, the JavaScript runtime
              will move it to the top of its scope and, therefore, there will be
              no complaint by the runtime if we use that variable before being
              declared.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Reassignment:</strong> 'var' variables can be reassigned
              and updated.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/j1.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>

          <!-- Let -->
          <li>
            <strong>let:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Block-Scoped:</strong> Variables declared with let are
              block-scoped. They are accessible only within the block where they
              are defined.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Hoisting:</strong> Variables declared with the let keyword
              are not subject to hoisting. This means I cannot use a variable
              unless it is declared and initialized.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Reassignment:</strong> let variables can be reassigned,
              but their value can change within the block scope.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/j2.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>

          <!-- const -->
          <li>
            <strong>const:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Block-Scoped:</strong> Like let, variables declared with
              const are block-scoped and only accessible within the block in
              which they are defined.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Hoisting:</strong> Similar to let, const is hoisted but
              not initialized with a value, resulting in a temporal dead zone.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Immutable:</strong> Variables declared with const cannot
              be reassigned after their initial assignment.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/j3.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-20 mt-8">
          In modern JavaScript development, it's recommended to use let for
          variables that may change their value and const for variables that
          should remain constant. var is used less frequently because its
          function-scoped and hoisting issue and unintended global variables.

      <!-- Question-2 -->
      <div class="flex items-center">
        <img

        <img class="w-14" src="images/Answer.jpg" alt="" />
        <p class="mb-4">
          In JavaScript, null and undefined are values used to represent missing
          or absent data, but they have slightly different use cases:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal font-semibold ml-4">
          <!-- Null -->
          <li>
            <strong>null:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Intentional Absence:</strong> The primary use case for
              null is to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property
              intentionally has no value or that it is empty. It is a
              programmer-defined value to signify emptiness.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>As a Placeholder:</strong> I can use null as a placeholder
              value when i want to assign a meaningful value to a variable or
              property later in my code.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Comparisons:</strong> null is used in conditional
              statements or comparisons to check if a variable or property has
              "nothing" to set intentionally
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/null.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>

          <!-- undefined -->
          <li>
            <strong>undefined:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Default Value:</strong> undefined is a primitive value
              automatically assigned by JavaScript to indicate the unintentional
              absence of any object value.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Function Parameters:</strong> If a function is called with
              fewer arguments than declared in its parameters, the missing
              parameters are set to undefined.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Property Access:</strong> lf I try to access an object
              that does not exist, I will get the result of undefined.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/undefined.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-20 mt-8">
          In summary, null is used when i want to indicate the absence of a
          value for a variable or property, whereas undefined is often
          automatically assigned to variables or properties when they haven't
          been assigned a value.

      <!-- Question-3 -->

      <div class="flex items-center">

          What do you mean by REST API?

      </div>
      <div class="mt-6 text-base md:text-xl">
        <img class="w-14" src="images/Answer.jpg" alt="" />
        <p class="mb-4">
          A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the
          REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this
          reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-10 mt-8">
          RESTful APIs are commonly used for web services that serve data over
          the internet. They are popular due to their simplicity, scalability,
          and compatibility with the HTTP protocol, making them accessible to a
          wide range of clients and platforms.
