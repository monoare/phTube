          Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6 text-xl">
        <p class="mb-4">
          In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but
          they differ in terms of their scope, hoisting behavior, and
          mutability. Understanding their scope is essential for writing clean
          and maintainable code. Let's discuss the scope of each of these
          variable declarations:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal font-semibold ml-4">
          <!-- var -->
          <li>
            <strong>Var:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Function-scoped:</strong> Variables declared with var are
              function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the
              function in which they are declared, or globally if declared
              outside of any function.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Hoisting:</strong> Variables declared with var are hoisted
              to the top of their containing function or the global scope, which
              means the variable declaration is moved to the top during
              compilation, but the initialization remains in place.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Reassignment:</strong> 'var' variables can be reassigned
              and updated.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/j1.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>

          <!-- Let -->
          <li>
            <strong>let:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Block-Scoped:</strong> Variables declared with let are
              block-scoped. They are accessible only within the block (e.g.,
              inside loops, conditionals, or functions) where they are defined.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Hoisting:</strong> Like var, let is also hoisted, but it
              is not initialized with a value. This results in a "temporal dead
              zone" where you cannot access the variable before its declaration
              in the code.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Reassignment:</strong> let variables can be reassigned,
              but their value can change within the block scope.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/j2.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>

          <!-- const -->
          <li>
            <strong>const:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Block-Scoped:</strong> Like let, variables declared with
              const are block-scoped and only accessible within the block in
              which they are defined.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Hoisting:</strong> Similar to let, const is hoisted but
              not initialized with a value, resulting in a temporal dead zone.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Immutable:</strong> Variables declared with const cannot
              be reassigned after their initial assignment. However, the value
              they refer to can be mutated if it is an object or an array.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/j3.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-20 mt-8">
          In modern JavaScript development, it's recommended to use let for
          variables that may change their value and const for variables that
          should remain constant. var is used less frequently due to its
          function-scoped nature and potential issues with hoisting and
          unintended global variables.

          Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6 text-xl">
        <p class="mb-4">
          In JavaScript, null and undefined are two distinct values used to
          represent missing or absent data, but they have slightly different use
          cases:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal font-semibold ml-4">
          <!-- Null -->
          <li>
            <strong>null:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Intentional Absence:</strong> The primary use case for
              null is to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property
              intentionally has no value or that it is empty. It is a
              programmer-defined value to signify emptiness.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>As a Placeholder:</strong> You might use null as a
              placeholder value when you plan to assign a meaningful value to a
              variable or property later in your code.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Comparisons:</strong> You can use null in conditional
              statements or comparisons to check if a variable or property has
              been intentionally set to "nothing."
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/null.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>

          <!-- undefined -->
          <li>
            <strong>undefined:</strong>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Default Value:</strong> When a variable or object property
              is declared but not initialized, it is automatically assigned the
              value undefined. It represents the absence of a value that was
              never set.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Function Parameters:</strong> If a function is called with
              fewer arguments than declared in its parameters, the missing
              parameters are set to undefined.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Property Access:</strong> lf you try to access an object
              property that does not exist, you will get undefined.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">Example:</p>
            <img class="my-4" src="images/undefined.JPG" alt="" />
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-20 mt-8">
          In summary, null is typically used when you want to explicitly
          indicate the absence of a value for a variable or property, whereas
          undefined is often automatically assigned to variables or properties
          when they haven't been assigned a value. It's essential to understand
          these distinctions to write clean and predictable JavaScript code.

          What do you mean by REST API?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6 text-xl">
        <p class="mb-4">
          REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application
          Programming Interface. It is a set of architectural principles and
          constraints for designing networked applications. REST is not a
          specific technology or protocol but rather a style of designing web
          services and APIs. RESTful APIs are designed to be simple, scalable,
          and stateless, making them widely used for building web services and
          APIs on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>Key characteristics and principles of REST APIs include:</p>
        <ol class="list-disc font-semibold ml-4">
          <!-- 1 -->
          <li>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Statelessness:</strong> Each request from a client to a
              server must contain all the information needed to understand and
              process the request. The server should not rely on any previous
              requests or shared state. This simplifies server design and
              scalability.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- 2 -->
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Resources:</strong> In a REST API, resources are the key
              abstractions. Resources can be thought of as any data or entity
              that can be manipulated. Resources are identified by unique URIs
              (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- 3 -->
          <li>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>HTTP Methods:</strong> RESTful APIs use standard HTTP
              methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform CRUD (Create,
              Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. For example, GET is
              used to retrieve data, POST to create new resources, PUT to update
              resources, and DELETE to remove resources.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- 4 -->
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Representation:</strong> Resources can have multiple
              representations (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML) to describe their state.
              Clients can specify the desired representation using the Accept
              header, and servers can respond with the appropriate format.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- 5 -->
          <li>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Stateless Communication:</strong> Each request between
              client and server must be self-contained. Servers should not store
              any client state between requests. This makes REST APIs highly
              scalable and allows for easy load balancing.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- 6 -->
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Uniform Interface:</strong> REST APIs have a consistent
              and uniform interface, which simplifies both client and server
              implementations. This uniformity is achieved through the use of
              HTTP methods and status codes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- 7 -->
          <li>
            <p class="my-4">
              <strong>Client-Server Architecture:</strong> The client and server
              are separate entities that communicate over a network. This
              separation allows for better scalability and flexibility.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- 8 -->
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Layered System:</strong> REST allows for a layered system
              architecture where each component (e.g., load balancers, caching,
              security) is separate and can be modified or replaced without
              affecting the overall system.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-10 mt-8">
          RESTful APIs are commonly used for web services that serve data over
          the internet. They are popular due to their simplicity, scalability,
          and compatibility with the HTTP protocol, making them accessible to a
          wide range of clients and platforms. REST has become the dominant
          architectural style for building APIs on the web.
